# Getting tokens from apps.twitter.com
# The apps.twitter.com application interface offers the ability to generate an OAuth access token for the owner of the application. This is useful if:
# Your application only needs to make requests on behalf of a single user (for example, establishing a connection to the Streaming API).
# You wish to test API functionality from a single account before worrying about the 3-Legged OAuth flow.


# Generating a token
# Start by navigating to the apps.twitter.com interface and logging in (if needed).
# Once logged in, the home page contains a list of the applications you have created, along with a button to create a new application.
